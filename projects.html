        <!-- I've been trying to figure out a way to recycle the carousel to use for each project, but HTML custom elements don't seem to be able to be reused multiple times over one page. I'm going to hard code each carousel in for now but I want to figure out a way to reuse that element and be able to change the images it recieves with each use without using React components. -->

                            PokéSearch was created using technologies such as
                            HTML, CSS, Javascript and jQuery and a third party
                            Pokémon API.

                            This project allows users to search the API for
                            information on any specific Pokemon as well as
                            Berries from any Pokemon Title.
