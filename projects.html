                            PokéSearch was created using technologies such as
                            HTML, CSS, Javascript and jQuery and a third party
                            Pokémon API.

                            A hangman game that uses Vite + React + TS, hosted
                            through Firebase. This game was created as a fun
                            personal project that I used to help strengthen my
                            Typescript skills as well as to reinforce core React
                            fundamentals such as hooks (useState, useCallback,
                            useEffect), managing state and prop drilling.

                            The game allows you to use the on-screen keyboard or
                            your physical keyboard! This game is still in
                            deveopment, features and style will evolve over
                            time.
