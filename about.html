                    my name is Patrick. Technology is something that I've always
                    felt passionate about from as of an age young as I can
                    remember. Fortunately enough, so were organization,
                    functionality, and design. Having moved quite a few times
                    growing up, I find adapting to new environments exciting. My
                    Eagerness to be continually learning, and my stoke to share
                    my knowledge both sustain my drive to grow not only as an
                    engineer, but as a human being.

                    My journey into the professional world began with the
                    pursuit of a college degree. Entering college, like so many
                    others, I was not confident in the major I chose. There were
                    many topics I was interested in and felt the pressure so I
                    chose to obtain a degree in Graphic Design. I spent my time
                    in higher education building my skills as not only an
                    artist, but also a logical and efficient thinker learning
                    about the complexities and the psychology of design.

                    Eventually I ended up realizing that I found more passionate
                    in the technology I was using over the art itself. I had
                    taken and enjoyed a couple web design courses in college, so
                    I decided my next step would be continuing down that road. I
                    embarked on this new path in my professional journey by
                    making the decision to get a high quality education at
                    General Assembly, where I attended a full-time Software
                    Engineering bootcamp. Having thoroughly enjoyed the logical
                    and critical thinking aspect of building software while
                    still exercising my creative muscles by creating responsive
                    and attractive layouts, features, animations, etc., I knew
                    that this would be a fantastic path for me to follow. Today,
                    I am pursuing my professional evolution as a Software
                    Engineer, using my talents in Graphic Design to help me and
                    my work stand out among the crowd.
