                    My professional journey began with my pursuit of a college
                    degree. Like many, I lacked confidence in my choice of
                    major. Faced with numerous interests I ultimately committed
                    to studying graphic design. Throughout college, I honed my
                    skills as a logical and efficient thinker, learning the
                    concepts and psychological aspects of communication through
                    design, specifically focusing on the layout of information.
                    <br /><br />

                    Years later I came to realize that my passion for tech was
                    stronger than it was for design so I made the decision to
                    shift from graphic design to software development. Drawn to
                    the combination of logical problem-solving and creative
                    architechture involved in software engineering, I enrolled
                    in a software engineering bootcamp at General Assembly.
                    Through this immersive experience, I found satisfaction in
                    the critical thinking and problem solving that software
                    development demands, while still being able to exercise my
                    design experience by crafting responsive layouts and
                    interactive features.
                    <br /><br />

                    I'm currently pursuing my professional evolution as a
                    Software Engineer. Leveraging my background in Graphic
                    Design, I aim to infuse intuitive UI into my work,
                    differentiating myself from the average engineer in this
                    competitive field.
