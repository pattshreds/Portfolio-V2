                    My name is Patrick, and I've harbored a passion for
                    technology since a young age. Alongside this, I possess a
                    strong interest for organization, functionality, and design.
                    Having gone through many relocations during my upbringing, I
                    thrive on adapting to new environments. My enthusiasm for
                    perpetual learning, coupled with my desire to share
                    knowledge, fuels my personal and professional growth as an
                    engineer and as an individual.

                    My professional journey began with my pursuit of a college
                    degree. Like many, I initially lacked confidence in my
                    choice of major. Faced with numerous interests and
                    pressures, I ultimately opted for a degree in Graphic
                    Design. Throughout my college years, I honed my skills not
                    only as an artist but also as a logical and efficient
                    thinker and communicator, delving into the intricacies and
                    psychological aspects of design.

                <p class="about-p p-3">
                    After realizing my true passion lay more in technology than
                    art, I transitioned from graphic design to software
                    development. Drawn to the blend of logical problem-solving
                    and creative architechture involved in software engineering,
                    I enrolled in a full-time Software Engineering bootcamp at
                    General Assembly. Through this immersive experience, I found
                    satisfaction in the logical and critical thinking that
                    software development demands, while still being able to
                    exercise my creativity through crafting responsive layouts,
                    interactive features, and animations. I'm currently pursuing
                    my professional growth as a Software Engineer. Leveraging my
                    background in Graphic Design, I aim to infuse creativity
                    into my work, differentiating myself from the average
                    engineer in this competitive field.
