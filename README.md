# Welcome to V2!

<p>
  This time around I'm using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. My new portfolio will serve as a portfolio, contact page, and in the future a blog.

## To-do List
<ul>
  <li><s> Eliminate dropdown menu. </s></li>
  <li><s> Build Experience and Contact page. </s></li>
  <li><s> Completely restyle entire project. </s></li>
  <li><s>  Style carousel navigation buttons more efficiently. </s></li>
  <li><s> Build a custom HTMLElement carousel component that's reusable for all project carousels. </s></li>
  <li><s> Write logic to handle rendering the correct project photos for each instance of the carousel component. </s></li>
  <li><s> Write logic to handle rendering the correct GitHub and live site links for the carousel component. </s></li>
  <li><s> Make each tech-logo animate individually with a delay. </s></li>
  <li><s> Write a line that removes the animation class when seciton is off page. </s></li>
  <li> Start building blog page. </li>
  <li> Write CSS for as many screen sizes as I can. </li>
  <li> In the index.html file I want to dynamically make the home-container take up the whole page so the tech-exp container must be scrolled to see. Right now I'm using a margin-bottom on the home-container to push it down but I want a more elegant solution. </li>
  <li> On the projects page make the currentDot class active on page load rather than only when the slides is interacted with. </li>
  <li> Add media queries for these mobile dimensions (Galaxy S21+) 411 x 781. </li>
</ul>
